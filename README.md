# An E-commerce Website Migration Software Tool for Small Businesses
The project aims to develop a migration software tool for small businesses on a well-known
e-commerce platform, such as eBay and Taobao, so that they can launch their independent e-
commerce sites to further expand their business. The software tool can extract data from the
e-commerce platform and generate a new well-designed full-functional sane-commerce
website. The user can choose what data they want to transfer and choose a satisfactory
website template, then the software will automatically generate a fully functional offline
website and sent the open-source code to the user. Besides, because the data migration and
construction of an e-commerce website may involve legal issues, the software has a legal
terms database, and on this basis to build a search engine combining with special query
features. In order to facilitate the solution of problems and sharing experience, this project
also established a social platform, which realized the functions of email registration, posting,
comment, private message, thumb up, follow and website visit statistics. The website has a
warning mechanism to alert merchants about legal risks and possible solutions. Our software
also has a data analysis function, which can provide real-time visualization of product data
and order information in real-time
